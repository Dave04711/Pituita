# Pituita

A multiplayer prototype based on **prop-hunt mechanics**, where players are divided into two teams.  
One team can **transform into environmental props** to hide, while the other team must **hunt them down**.

---

## 🎯 Core Concept

**Pituita** differentiates itself from other prop-hunt games by introducing *dual victory conditions*.  
The **hunters** win not only by capturing all aliens from the opposing team but also if the **time limit expires**.  
Meanwhile, the **aliens** (hiders) must remain undetected **and** complete **tasks** scattered across the map before time runs out.

## 👽 Alien Abilities

Aliens can perform a **dash**, allowing them to quickly reposition in their base form.  
They can also **morph into props**, blending into the surroundings to hide from hunters.

### Unique Alien Traits (for each character):
- Faster task completion ⏩  
- Ability to escape from a capture station independently 🏃‍♂️  
- Higher jump when launched off a teammate’s back 🦘

## 🎯 Hunter Gadgets

Hunters rely on specialized gadgets to **counter alien behavior** and **detect disguised enemies**.

- **Unmorphing Grenade** – covers a wide area, forcing disguised aliens to revert to their base form and preventing them from morphing again for a short duration.  
- **Laser Grid** – blocks access to selected vents or narrow passages, cutting off potential escape routes.  
- **Motion Sensor** – triggers an alarm and notifies the owner when movement is detected nearby.  

Hunters must capture aliens in their base form using the **catching gadget**, then place them in a **containment station** to secure the capture.  
Captured aliens can be rescued by their **teammates** if left unattended for too long.
